# ConFrontJS 2019 Warsaw

This app was prepared by me to support my speak on Warsaw conference ConFrontJS happened on 07-12-2019.

Repository has 3 tags:
1. Tag `step1` is the starting point for application - we have frontend and backend prepared
2. Tag `step2` has infrastructure stack initialized by CDK
3. Tag `step3` has complete code that is required to deploy stack with CDK

Feel free to do with this whatever you like.
